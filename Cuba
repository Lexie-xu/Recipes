# Potato Balls

## Ingredients:

- 4 large potatoes, peeled and cubed
- 1 ½ teaspoons salt, divided
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1 green bell pepper, chopped
- ½ cup chopped onion
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 pound ground beef
- 4 teaspoons tomato paste
- 1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar
- 2 teaspoons ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 4 large eggs
- 2 cups dry bread crumbs
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 quart vegetable oil for frying

## Directions:

1. **Prepare Potatoes:**
   - Place potatoes into a large pot; cover with salted water.
   - Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes.
   - Drain and allow to steam dry for 1 to 2 minutes.
   - Mash potatoes with 1/2 teaspoon salt in a bowl until no lumps remain. Set aside to cool to room temperature.

2. **Prepare Vegetable and Beef Mixture:**
   - Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
   - Cook and stir green pepper, onion, and garlic until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 10 minutes.
   - Increase heat to medium-high; stir in ground beef.
   - Cook and stir until beef is crumbly and no longer pink.
   - Stir in tomato paste, vinegar, cumin, 1 teaspoon salt, and pepper until tomato paste has dissolved.
   - Transfer beef mixture to a bowl; allow to cool to room temperature.

3. **Assembly:**
   - Line a baking sheet with plastic wrap or waxed paper.
   - Beat eggs in a mixing bowl; set aside.
   - Pour bread crumbs and flour into separate, shallow dishes; set aside.
   - Form potato and beef mixture into small bowl shapes, fill with beef mixture, seal edges, and smooth to make a round ball.

4. **Coating and Refrigeration:**
   - Gently roll potato balls in flour to coat; shake off excess.
   - Dip into beaten egg, then roll in bread crumbs.
   - Place breaded potato balls onto the prepared baking sheet.
   - Refrigerate for 2 to 4 hours or freeze for later use.

5. **Frying:**
   - Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 350°F (175°C).
   - Cook potato balls in hot oil in batches until crispy and golden brown, about 3 minutes per batch.
   - Use tongs to roll balls around as they cook to ensure even browning.
   - Drain on a paper towel-lined plate.
