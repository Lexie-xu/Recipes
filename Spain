# Spanish Omelette

## Ingredients:

- 500g new potatoes
- 1 onion, preferably white
- 150ml extra-virgin olive oil
- 3 tbsp chopped flat-leaf parsley
- 6 eggs

## Instructions:

1. **Prepare Potatoes and Onion:**
   - Scrape the new potatoes or leave the skins on, if you prefer. Cut them into thick slices.
   - Chop the onion.

2. **Cook Potatoes and Onion:**
   - Heat the extra-virgin olive oil in a large frying pan.
   - Add the potatoes and onion, stew gently, partially covered, for 30 mins, stirring occasionally until the potatoes are softened.
   - Strain the potatoes and onion through a colander into a large bowl (set the strained oil aside).

3. **Prepare Egg Mixture:**
   - Beat the eggs separately.
   - Stir the beaten eggs into the potatoes with the parsley and season with plenty of salt and pepper.

4. **Cook the Omelette:**
   - Heat a little of the strained oil in a smaller pan.
   - Tip the egg and potato mixture into the pan and cook on a moderate heat, using a spatula to shape the omelette into a cushion.

5. **Invert and Cook:**
   - When almost set, invert the omelette on a plate.
   - Slide it back into the pan and cook for a few more minutes.
   - Invert twice more, cooking the omelette briefly each time and pressing the edges to keep the cushion shape.

6. **Serve:**
   - Slide the Spanish omelette onto a plate and cool for 10 mins before serving.
