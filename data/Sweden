   - Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C).

2. **Prepare Potatoes:**
   - Wash and scrub the potatoes thoroughly.
   - Place a potato on a cutting board, flat side down. Make thin slices across the potato, being careful not to cut all the way through. Use chopsticks or wooden spoons as guides to prevent cutting through the bottom.

4. **Bake:**
   - Transfer the potatoes to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
   - Bake in the preheated oven for about 45-55 minutes or until the potatoes are crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.

5. **Add Toppings:**
   - In a small bowl, mix melted butter, breadcrumbs, and Parmesan cheese.
   - Carefully spoon the mixture over the potatoes, ensuring it gets between the slices.

6. **Finish Baking:**
   - Return the potatoes to the oven and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes or until the cheese is melted and golden brown.

7. **Garnish and Serve:**
   - Remove from the oven and garnish with chopped fresh parsley.
