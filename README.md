# Recipes Exploration Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to explore cultural and lifestyle differences by analyzing recipes of the same ingredient across different regions. By collecting, organizing, and analyzing data, we intend to gain insights into unique ways different regions utilize and cook with the same ingredient, shedding light on potential cultural and societal backgrounds behind these differences.

## Dataset

We have collected recipe data from the following regions:

- [Bangladesh](data/Bangladesh.csv)
- [Canada](data/Canada.csv)
- [China](data/China.csv)
- [Cuba](data/Cuba.csv)
- [Italy](data/Italy.csv)
- [Spain](data/Spain.csv)
- [Sweden](data/Sweden.csv)
