# Gnocchi

## Ingredients
- 1 kg floury potatoes (such as Maris Piper, King Edward)
- 100 g Tipo 00 flour, plus extra for dusting
- 1 whole nutmeg (for grating)
## Instructions

1. **Prepare Potatoes:**
   - Use potatoes of a fairly even size, as you’re going to cook them whole.
   - Cook in a large pan of boiling salted water for 20 to 25 minutes, or until tender.
   - Drain and leave until cool enough to handle, then remove the skins.

2. **Mash Potatoes:**
   - Mash the potatoes using a potato ricer or masher onto a large clean board.
   - Sprinkle over the flour, finely grate over half the nutmeg, season well with sea salt and black pepper.
   - Scrunch and push the mixture together with clean hands. Add more flour if needed.

3. **Knead and Shape:**
   - Knead on a flour-dusted surface for a few minutes until pliable.
   - Divide into 4 equal pieces and roll each into a sausage about 2cm thick.
   - Slice into 3cm lengths – this is your basic gnocchi.
   - Optionally, roll each piece down a butter pat, the back of a fork, or a fine grater to add grooves.

4. **Cook Gnocchi:**
   - Cook gnocchi 2 portions at a time in a pan of boiling salted water for 2 to 3 minutes.
   - As soon as they come up to the surface, they’re ready.
   - Remove with a slotted spoon.

5. **Serve:**
   - Toss cooked gnocchi with melted butter and finely grated Parmesan.
   - Optionally, use Hero tomato sauce or leftover sauce from a stew.
   - Finely grate over a little Parmesan before serving.
   - Add a dollop of pesto if desired (homemade or jarred).
